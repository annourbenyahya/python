# Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute its area.
# Get user input for base and height
base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

# Calculate area
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Print result
print(f"Area of the triangle: {area}")
